However, yet, it is a controversial issue to use ChatGPT in academic\\nresearch. Recently, its impact on academic research and publication has been scrutinized. The\\nfundamental objective of this study is to highlight the application of ChatGPT in academic\\nresearch by demonstrating a practical example with some recommendations. Data for this study\\nwas gathered using published articles, websites, blogs, and visual and numerical artefacts. We\\nhave analyzed, synthesized, and described our gathered data using an \"introductory literature\\nreview.\" The ﬁndings revealed that for the initial idea generation for academic scientiﬁc research,\\nChatGPT could be an eﬀective tool. However, in the case of literature synthesis, citations, problem\\nstatements, research gaps, and data analysis, the researchers might encounter some challenges.\\nTherefore, in these cases, researchers must be cautious about using ChatGPT in academic research.\\nConsidering the potential applications and consequences of ChatGPT, it is a must for the academic\\nand scientiﬁc community to establish the necessary guidelines for the appropriate use of LLMs,\\nespecially ChatGPT, in research and publishing.\\nKeywords: Academic, AI, ChatGPT, LLMs, Research, Recommendation\\nDOI: http://doi.org/ 10.52631 /jemds.v 3i1.175\\n1 Introduction\\nChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM), is a recent development in language model technology\\nthat might provide researchers with a powerful tool to support their work. LLMs such as ChatGPT\\ncan generate human-like text by imitating the statistical patterns of language in vast datasets from\\nthe internet. ChatGPT can generate convincing sentences using Natural Language Processing\\n(NLP) for the researchers. Few recent studies have examined the potentiality and use of ChatGPT\\nin various parts or domains of academic research. For example, Grimaldi and Ehrler (2023) and', metadata={'source': 'ChatGPTandAcademicResearch.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Hutson et al. (2022) have taken a broad perspective on the emerging role of AI in scholarly\\nresearch.\\nHowever, another study done by M Alshater (2022) and the ﬁndings suggested that ChatGPT could\\nbe a helpful tool for constructing research ideas. Still, it is not an appropriate tool for empirical\\nresearch. Empirical research has some essential parts such as an abstract, introduction, literature\\nreview, methodology, results, discussions on ﬁndings, and conclusions. However, ChatGPT might\\nonly help cover some of these parts. For example, Aydın and Karaarslan (2022) attempted to\\ncomplete a healthcare literature review for an academic journal. Still, poor paraphrasing, lack of\\nsynthesis, and plagiarism were the leading causes of not getting a good literature review. On\\nthe other hand, Gao et al. (2022) found a well-structured abstract without explicit plagiarism.\\nHowever, it could be identiﬁed as being generated by an AI platform using an AI output detector.\\nAnother recent study was done by Dowling and Lucey (2023) on applying ChatGPT in ﬁnance\\nresearch. From the ﬁndings of that study, it is clear that for the initial idea generation, ChatGPT is\\nan excellent tool. Still, it must be more vital in literature synthesis and developing appropriate\\ntesting frameworks.\\nIn the academic world, academicians, researchers, and students have already employed LLMs such\\nas ChatGPT to complete their various academic and non-academic tasks. However, according\\nto Gordijn and Have (2023), ChatGPT still needs to improve at developing a whole scientiﬁc\\narticle than a good researcher. However, it is predicted that the capabilities and uses of these\\ntools may continue to expand to diﬀerent points, including designing experiments, writing and\\ncompleting manuscripts, conducting peer reviews, and supporting editorial decisions (van Dis et\\nal., 2023). Besides, ChatGPT can produce and receive texts in multiple languages, which helps\\ndisseminate knowledge; it may enable those whose ﬁrst language is not English to publish and\\naccess scholarly literature more eﬃciently (Liebrenz et al., 2023). However, considering the\\npotential consequences of ChatGPT, it might beneﬁt the academic community, but; it is a must\\nfor the scientiﬁc community to establish the necessary guidelines for the appropriate use of LLMs\\nin research and publishing.\\n1.1 Can ChatGPT be an Author or a Co-author? Current Status!\\nBesides ChatGPT, other LMSs have become widespread, thus; their impacts on academic research\\nand publication have been scrutinized. It is seen from the diﬀerent blogs and websites that some\\nauthors are considering ChatGPT as one of their co-authors. For instance, the studies- ChatGPT\\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer and Zhavoronkov (2022) and O’Connor and ChatGPT (2022)\\nhave listed the chatbot as the article’s author. Using ChatGPT and considering it as authorship\\nin academic research have sparked a debate about the future of scholarly research production\\n(Else, 2023, Stokel-Walker, 2023). Due to this concern, some renowned publishers such as Nature\\n(Nature, 2023) Springer-Nature (Springer-Nature, 2023), Elsevier (Elsevier, 2023), Taylor and\\nFrancis (Taylor Francis, 2023) have already updated their authorship policies. According to the\\nrecent authorship policies of Springer-Nature, ChatGPT cannot be listed as an author in any\\nacademic research paper. If any researchers uses these tools, s(he) must mention their use in the\\nappropriate section of their academic paper, such as the \"methodology\" or \"acknowledgment\"\\nsection (Dwivedi et al., 2023).\\nOn the other hand, Elsevier, a renowned publisher, has also revised its authorship policies due\\nto the extensive use of LLMs in academic research (Liebrenz et al., 2023). Elsevier stated that\\nLLMs could only help improve their articles’ language and readability, not data interpretation\\nor scientiﬁc ﬁndings (Sankaran, 2023). There are many debates about using LLMs in academic', metadata={'source': 'ChatGPTandAcademicResearch.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='LLMs could only help improve their articles’ language and readability, not data interpretation\\nor scientiﬁc ﬁndings (Sankaran, 2023). There are many debates about using LLMs in academic\\nresearch appropriately. From the above publishers’ recent authorship policies, it is clear that\\nhuman authors remain central to the academic research process. These debates will continue,\\nand many new policies and guidelines will be introduced due to the use of ChatGPT in academic\\nresearch. A few examples are given as the summary as shown in Table 1. To prepare this table,\\nthey took help from a study done by (Dwivedi et al., 2023).\\n2', metadata={'source': 'ChatGPTandAcademicResearch.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='Table 1.

Thus, the\\nresearchers are not allowed to list AI and\\nAI-assisted technologies as an author or co-\\nauthor nor cite AI as an author.ChatGPT cannot be an\\nauthor or co-author.\\n2 Methodology\\nThe authors selected a demo research topic titled \"Adoption of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in\\nHigher Education\" to highlight the application of ChatGPT and uncover the critical challenges of\\nemploying AI chatbots such as ChatGPT in academic research. ChatGPT version 3.5 was used to\\nassess its application in academic research. Besides, the researchers used an archive research\\ndesign. Researchers can use this method to collect information utilizing historical or non-historical\\ndocuments (Ventresca, 2017).\\nData for this study was gathered using websites, blogs, and visual and numerical artifacts. Data for\\narchive study is collected rather than generated. Archival research is a secondary data-collecting\\napproach that involves acquiring information from existing sources such as public documents,\\ncompany records, historical papers, websites, and blogs (Vogt et al., 2012). Archival data can\\nprovide a wealth of information about ﬁrms and how they function, including how they employ\\ntechnology. The researchers followed a few archival research processes from the McMaster\\nUniversity Library’s Research Guides (2023). The researchers have described the archival research\\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\\n3', metadata={'source': 'ChatGPTandAcademicResearch.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='Figure 1. Overall research process\\nThe researchers analyzed and described the collected data using an “introductory literature\\nreview.” Despite the widespread usage of an introductory literature review, it is usually diﬃcult\\nto justify. One of the consequences of the emergence of meta-analysis and other types of\\nsystematic reviews has been to raise the standard for all sorts of literature reviews. This is one of\\nthe outcomes of the rise of systematic reviews. Most people believe, at least on a fundamental\\nlevel, that research reports in a literature review require the same rigor, reliability, and objectivity\\nas any other examination of research ﬁndings. In this scenario, an introduction review is only\\nappropriate for a modest preliminary study or when the studied topic is addressed in only a few\\npublished articles (Vogt et al. 2012).\\n2.1 Applications of ChatGPT in Writing Research Articles Based on Practical Examples\\nIn recent years, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) has been considered one of the most eﬀective tools\\nfor developing education globally. And the interest in the application of AI in higher education is\\ngradually increasing. Hence, ChatGPT is a buzzword for the academic community, from students\\nto researchers. To prove this, researchers focused on the applications of ChatGPT in writing\\nresearch articles based on practical examples. Therefore, researchers selected a demo research\\ntopic titled “Adoption of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education” to highlight the application\\nof ChatGPT and to uncover the critical challenges of employing ChatGPT chatbots in academic\\nresearch. In this section, the researchers assessed the capability of ChatGPT in academic research\\nby providing several commands to write diﬀerent sections of the demo research manuscript,\\nincluding:\\n•Research idea generation\\n•Background/Introduction (including problem statement and research gaps)\\n•Literature review with citations and references,\\n•Methodology,\\n•Results and discussion.\\n2.2 ChatGPT and Research Idea Generation\\nThe experiment with ChatGPT revealed that the chatbot is quite successful in generating new\\nresearch ideas and developing research outlines. The authors may take these ideas to implement,\\nbut human interference is a must at any time and anywhere. Besides, ChatGPT can provide a\\ndetailed outline of a research paper.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'ChatGPTandAcademicResearch.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='2.3 ChatGPT and Introduction Including Problem Statement and Research Gaps\\nWriting a background or an introduction with the problem statement and research gap is one\\nof the most challenging tasks for academic researchers. The problem statement and gap are\\ncrucial components of an introduction to a research paper. The fundamental objective of a\\nproblem statement is to draw attention to the matter of concern and to clarify it so that it can be\\ninvestigated systematically. The researcher in this study asked ChatGPT to write the problem\\nstatement and research gap for the demo research topic. The prompt and the output from\\nChatGPT are presented as a snapshot in Figure 2.\\nFigure 2. Problem statement and research gap generated by ChatGPT\\nFrom the command and response from ChatGPT, it has been that the problem statement generated\\nby the chatbot is entirely hypothetical without any references. Further, ChatGPT needs to identify\\noriginal research gaps from the literature but provides a generalized gap for any research topic.\\nSince ChatGPT cannot access original articles, it cannot provide proper references for the gaps in\\nthe literature.\\n2.4 ChatGPT and Synthesis Literature Review\\nIn the second stage, ChatGPT has been asked to write a literature review on the “adoption of\\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in higher education” with APA-style in-text citations and references. The\\nprompt and the output from ChatGPT are presented as a snapshot in Figure 3.\\nFigure 3. Made-up nonexistent references\\nThe chatbot generated a literature review consisting of the literature ﬁndings from ﬁve articles.\\nChatGPT provided standard in-text citations and references in APA style. Moreover, for cross-\\nchecking, the researchers searched the references in google scholar and other scholarly research\\ndatabases. However, the researchers have yet to ﬁnd those references anywhere on the internet.\\n5', metadata={'source': 'ChatGPTandAcademicResearch.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='Interestingly, when asked to provide the DOI or the original URL of the references that ChatGPT\\nprovided, the AI chatbot mentioned that it does not have access to the original articles. Thus, it\\ngenerated a few made-up nonexistent in-text citations and references (Figure 4). ChatGPT cannot\\naccess academic references or other external data as an LLM. Its knowledge is derived from the\\ntraining text, which has a deﬁned endpoint. The AI bot cannot browse the internet or access\\nnew material that may have been released since its training data was gathered. Consequently,\\nthe inability of AI chatbots to perform an authentic literature review with original references is a\\nsigniﬁcant limitation of the blind use of AI chatbots in academic article writing.\\nFigure 4. Failure to provide authentic references\\nIn the next stage, the researchers tested the chatbot to determine whether it could adequately\\nsynthesize the literature. However, ChatGPT is less successful in synthesizing prior literature\\nﬁndings and writing a formal literature review. When asked to write a literature review on\\nthe “Adoption of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education,” the chatbot provided multiple\\nparagraphs citing a few studies and demonstrating their ﬁndings (Figure 5). However, no link was\\nestablished between the ﬁndings of the other literature. Hence, researchers should not solely\\nrely on the ChatGPT to write a literature review for an article.\\nFigure 5. Weak literature synthesis\\nFor example, Dowling and Lucey (2023) recently conducted a study on the application of ChatGPT\\nin Finance research by evaluating the generated output by ﬁnance journal reviewers. The authors\\nstated that this technology needs to be up to that level in synthesizing the literature and developing\\nappropriate testing frameworks. However, when private data and researchers’ domain expertise\\nare applied, chatGPT can oﬀer an improved literature review. Thus, it can be concluded that\\nresearchers can use ChatGPT as an assistant to summarize articles to write a literature review\\nfurther. However, due to less success in synthesizing prior literature ﬁndings, researchers should\\nnot rely entirely on the chatbot to write a literature review.\\n2.5 GPT and Findings Analysis\\nChatGPT is currently unable to analyze empirical data (Dowling and Lucey (2023). Therefore,\\nthe researchers could not assess its data analysis ability. They asked the chatbot to conduct a\\nthematic analysis on the demo topic without access to empirical data. ChatGPT mentioned that\\n6', metadata={'source': 'ChatGPTandAcademicResearch.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='with access to actual data, it could conduct a thematic analysis and write results section (Figure\\n6).\\nFigure 6. Failure to analyze the emperical data\\nAlthough the chatbot cannot analyze empirical data for quantitative techniques, researchers can\\ntake help from ChatGPT to know the necessary basic theoretical ideas about their analyzing tools\\nand techniques. However, for qualitative research, ChatGPT might be helpful for researchers. For\\ninstance, they can collect qualitative data from face-to-face interviews, key informant interviews,\\nand focus group discussions. If a researcher provides the transcribed qualitative data to ChatGPT\\nand asks it to analyze the text using appropriate prompts, ChatGPT might provide an adequate\\nqualitative analysis output. For instance, if they conduct a few interviews on the “Adoption\\nof AI in higher education” and provide the transcribed interview data to ChatGPT with proper\\ncommands, the chatbot can generate the expected results for the study. However, it requires\\nspeciﬁc expertise and the attention of the researcher to develop a sound output.\\n3 Results and Discussions\\nRecently, academicians and practitioners worldwide have taken a keen interest in ChatGPT,\\na conversational AI tool (Rahaman et al., 2023). It is anticipated that conversational AI may\\nentirely transform the research and publication process, which might bring opportunities or raise\\nworries. ChatGPT has diﬀerent prospects, including innovation process, promoting diversity in\\nscientiﬁc research perspectives, and short time- to-publication by simplifying writing. Besides\\nthese potentialities, it may undermine research quality and transparency and alter the autonomy\\nas human researchers. The authors’ interactions with ChatGPT assert that ChatGPT, an AI chatbot,\\ncan be an eﬀective research assistance tool for eﬃciently designing manuscripts. Swift answers\\nto any basic queries regarding academic research researchers can be possible through ChatGPT.\\nFurthermore, ChatGPT is readily accessible to researchers worldwide, anytime and anywhere,\\nwith an internet connection, thus making it an accessible research tool. Moreover, its capacity\\nto generate new and innovative outputs based on input can help researchers generate fresh\\nideas, perspectives, and insights. ChatGPT can enhance researchers’ productivity and enable\\nthem to focus on other aspects of their research by supporting tasks such as new idea generation,\\nliterature summarization, and writing assistance.\\nIn this research, the researchers tried to assess the capabilities of the ChatGPT in academic\\nresearch by using a demo research topic titled “Adoption of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in Higher\\nEducation.” They attempted to investigate the challenges of using ChatGPT in writing a paper.\\nThe ﬁndings revealed that ChatGPT could generate a standard abstract for a research article when\\ngiven accurate and precise prompts. However, it fails to generate standard output for diﬀerent\\nresearch article sections. For instance, the AI chatbot generates a hypothetical problem statement\\nand research gaps for the introduction section. As it cannot access original articles, it can not\\nidentify the original research gap for a particular research topic.\\nAdditionally, The researchers found that ChatGPT generates fake made-up citations while writing\\nany literature review. They cross-checked all the given references in academic databases and\\nfound that all of the references are hypothetical. Further, the tool must synthesize the literature,\\n7', metadata={'source': 'ChatGPTandAcademicResearch.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='the fundamental objective of writing a literature review. It cannot conduct statistical analysis\\nas it cannot access actual data. One cannot upload dataﬁle into ChatGPT; thus, the tool cannot\\nconduct empirical analysis. However, ChatGPT can provide a decent output for a few qualitative\\ndata analyses if the transcribed data is provided.\\nAdditionally, it can write a proper methodology if the researcher can provide all the information\\nregarding the research methods used. However, giving an accurate prompt is crucial in this\\ncontext. Some of the other limitations of using ChatGPT in writing research articles include\\nbut are not limited to the next section. The ﬁrst and foremost limitation is that ChatGPT can\\nproduce well-structured and coherent text but cannot generate original and creative ideas, which\\nis crucial in academic research where originality and creativity are highly valued. Second, ChatGPT\\nis trained on a vast corpus of text data that may include biases and inaccuracies, leading to\\nbiased results and aﬀecting performance. The following limitation is that ChatGPT is an AI model\\nand cannot be held accountable for the validity and accuracy of its generated results, which\\ncan pose a challenge in academic research where accountability and transparency are crucial.\\nThe last fast limitation is ChatGPT, which cannot understand the context of the generated text,\\nwhich can produce irrelevant or inappropriate text, particularly in situations requiring a nuanced\\nunderstanding of the topic. Finally, last but not least, the results generated by ChatGPT can be\\nchallenging to interpret and understand, limiting the researchers’ ability to validate the results\\nand identify the underlying sources of bias or inaccuracies.\\nDespite these challenges, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in academic research, mainly when used\\nwith other techniques and methods. The use of ChatGPT in academic research holds signiﬁcant\\npotential, including improved eﬃciency, accuracy, and communication. By leveraging these\\nbeneﬁts, researchers can gain new insights into their research domains and better communicate\\ntheir ﬁndings to a broader audience. The use of ChatGPT in academic research is a rapidly growing\\narea. As technology continues to develop, researchers can expect to see even more beneﬁts\\nemerge in the future.\\n4 Summary of the Findings and Recommendations for Academic Researcher\\nBased on the researchers’ practical example, a summary of the ﬁndings relating to the various\\nparts of an academic research paper is shown in Table 2. Besides, the authors of this study suggest\\nsome recommendations for academic researchers:\\nTable 2. Recommendations for Academic Researcher\\nComponents of\\nAcademic ResearchAuthors’ Findings Recommendations\\nInitial Idea Generation ChatGPT is an eﬀective tool for\\nidea generation, brainstorming,\\nand outlining research topics.As no ethical considerations\\nare associated with initial idea\\ngeneration, thus; for this section,\\nthe researchers can use ChatGPT.\\nNonetheless, researchers should\\nverify the accuracy and reliability\\nof any information provided by\\nChatGPT.\\n8', metadata={'source': 'ChatGPTandAcademicResearch.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='Introduction The authors’ found that ChatGPT\\ncan generate an introduction\\nwithout a formal problem\\nstatement and research gap.\\nBesides, the introduction part is\\nentirely hypothetical, without\\nany references.ChatGPT can support identifying\\nnew research directions, ﬁnding\\npotential research questions,\\nand formulating hypothesis.\\nBut, it is strongly recommended\\nthat academic researchers only\\npartially depend on ChatGPT for\\nthis crucial part as it cannot be\\nutilized to accurately generate\\nresearch questions, problem\\nstatements, research gaps, and\\nhypothesis.\\nLiterature Review ChatGPT can summarise and\\ncompile the literature into\\na literature review without\\nemphasizing synthesizing and\\ncoherence. ChatGPT cannot\\ndevelop a story based on existing\\nliterature. Second, if a researcher\\ninstructs ChatGPT to compose\\na literature review, it generates\\nﬁctitious and hypothetical in-text\\ncitations and references.The researchers advise utilizing\\nChatGPT to summarise extensive\\nliterature rather than writing the\\nliterature review section by using\\nChatGPT. Besides, academic\\nresearchers are requested to\\nrefrain from using citations\\nand references produced from\\nChatGPT directly.\\nMethodology ChatGPT can provide a decent\\noutput for a few qualitative data\\nanalyses if the transcribed data\\nis provided. Additionally, it can\\nwrite a proper methodology if\\nthe researcher can provide all\\nthe information regarding the\\nresearch methods used.Academic researchers might\\ntake help from ChatGPT to get\\na preliminary idea of how to\\ndesign their methodology section.\\nHowever, all the information\\nconcerning methodology needs\\nto be input properly according\\nto the nature (qualitative or\\nquantitative) of the research,\\nData Analysis and\\nFindingsThe researchers cannot upload\\ndata ﬁles (Excel, SPSS) to\\nChatGPT, so they cannot be\\nused for empirical analysis. But\\nif the transcribed data is given,\\nChatGPT can provide good\\nresults for a few qualitative data\\nanalyses.For quantitative data analysis, the\\nresearcher should avoid ChatGPT.\\nBut, researchers can take help\\nfrom ChatGPT to know the\\nnecessary basic theoretical ideas\\nabout their analyzing tools and\\ntechniques.\\nOverall Recommendations: ChatGPT should be utilized as one of many research information\\nsources. Instead, it should be utilized as a complement to help improve the study procedure.\\nFinally, as ChatGPT is NLP which is ﬁrmly command based, the new AI model can be helpful to\\nthe academic researcher with the understanding of human interference when needed.\\n5 Conclusion and Implications\\nThe fundamental objective of this study is to highlight the application of ChatGPT in academic\\nresearch by demonstrating a practical example with some valuable recommendations. This study\\ndraws upon a demo research topic and investigates the potential and limitations of ChatGPT in\\ndrafting and writing an academic research paper. The study revealed that ChatGPT has several\\nadvantages for researchers regarding new idea generation, outlining a research topic, even writing\\nabstracts using prompts, etc. Second, the researchers recommend that academic researchers\\n9', metadata={'source': 'ChatGPTandAcademicResearch.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='may use this tool to summarize large text and identify key ﬁndings from the literature. However,\\nthe researchers also observed several limitations of ChatGPT in writing an academic article. For\\ninstance, ChatGPT sometimes misleads in writing the research problem, questions, and gaps since\\nit provides hypothetical problem statements and research gaps with fake references. However, it\\nshould only be used to write part of the literature review section as the tool can not synthesize\\nliterature and generates made-up citations and references. Besides, ChatGPT cannot conduct\\nstatistical analysis because it cannot access the dataset. Thus, the researchers recommend not\\nusing ChatGPT to write a research article alone; human control should be apparent. Instead, this\\ntool can be used as an e-research assistant that can complement diﬀerent works of a researcher\\nand improve work eﬃciency. Since accountability and research integrity are two major concerns\\nin academic publishing, researchers should take full accountability for using ChatGPT in research\\nand mention its use in the article. As this is one of the ﬁrst studies that assess the application of\\nChatGPT in academic research, the ﬁndings will have full and crucial implications for theory and\\npractice.\\n6 Acknowledgment\\nAll authors would like to express their gratitude to the authors of the cited literature for their\\nassistance and important information. Besides, the authors are grateful for the ChatGPT-3.5\\nversion as the authors designed this study and took some screenshots using ChatGPT-3.5.\\nFunding Statement: The authors did not receive any funds for this research.\\nConﬂict of Interest: The authors declare no conﬂict of interest.\\nEthics approval statement: Not applicable as the data has been taken from secondary sources.\\nData availability Statement: Not applicable as the data has been taken from secondary sources.\\nReferences\\nAydın, , & Karaarslan, E.

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM), is a recent development in language model technology\n",
      "that might provide researchers with a powerful tool to support their work. LLMs such as ChatGPT\n",
      "can generate human-like text by imitating the statistical patterns of language in vast datasets from\n",
      "the internet. ChatGPT can generate convincing sentences using Natural Language Processing\n",
      "(NLP) for the researchers. Few recent studies have examined the potentiality and use of ChatGPT\n",
      "in various parts or domains of academic research. For example, Grimaldi and Ehrler (2023) andHutson et al. (2022) have taken a broad perspective on the emerging role of AI in scholarly\n",
      "research.\n",
      "However, another study done by M Alshater (2022) and the ﬁndings suggested that ChatGPT could\n",
      "be a helpful tool for constructing research ideas. Still, it is not an appropriate tool for empirical\n",
      "research. Empirical research has some essential parts such as an abstract, introduction, literature\n",
      "review, methodology, results, discussions on ﬁndings, and conclusions. However, ChatGPT might\n",
      "only help cover some of these parts. For example, Aydın and Karaarslan (2022) attempted to\n",
      "complete a healthcare literature review for an academic journal. Still, poor paraphrasing, lack of\n",
      "synthesis, and plagiarism were the leading causes of not getting a good literature review. On\n",
      "the other hand, Gao et al. (2022) found a well-structured abstract without explicit plagiarism.\n",
      "However, it could be identiﬁed as being generated by an AI platform using an AI output detector.\n",
      "Another recent study was done by Dowling and Lucey (2023) on applying ChatGPT in ﬁnance\n",
      "research. From the ﬁndings of that study, it is clear that for the initial idea generation, ChatGPT is\n",
      "an excellent tool. Still, it must be more vital in literature synthesis and developing appropriate\n",
      "testing frameworks.\n",
      "In the academic world, academicians, researchers, and students have already employed LLMs such\n",
      "as ChatGPT to complete their various academic and non-academic tasks. However, according\n",
      "to Gordijn and Have (2023), ChatGPT still needs to improve at developing a whole scientiﬁc\n",
      "article than a good researcher. However, it is predicted that the capabilities and uses of these\n",
      "tools may continue to expand to diﬀerent points, including designing experiments, writing and\n",
      "completing manuscripts, conducting peer reviews, and supporting editorial decisions (van Dis et\n",
      "al., 2023). Besides, ChatGPT can produce and receive texts in multiple languages, which helps\n",
      "disseminate knowledge; it may enable those whose ﬁrst language is not English to publish and\n",
      "access scholarly literature more eﬃciently (Liebrenz et al., 2023). However, considering the\n",
      "potential consequences of ChatGPT, it might beneﬁt the academic community, but; it is a must\n",

      "Besides ChatGPT, other LMSs have become widespread, thus; their impacts on academic research\n",

      "authors are considering ChatGPT as one of their co-authors. For instance, the studies- ChatGPT\n",
      "Generative Pre-trained Transformer and Zhavoronkov (2022) and O’Connor and ChatGPT (2022)\n",

      "The authors selected a demo research topic titled \"Adoption of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in\n",
      "Higher Education\" to highlight the application of ChatGPT and uncover the critical challenges of\n",
      "employing AI chatbots such as ChatGPT in academic research. ChatGPT version 3.5 was used to\n",
      "assess its application in academic research. Besides, the researchers used an archive research\n",
      "design. Researchers can use this method to collect information utilizing historical or non-historical\n",
      "documents (Ventresca, 2017).\n",
      "Data for this study was gathered using websites, blogs, and visual and numerical artifacts. Data for\n",
      "archive study is collected rather than generated. Archival research is a secondary data-collecting\n",
      "approach that involves acquiring information from existing sources such as public documents,\n",
      "company records, historical papers, websites, and blogs (Vogt et al., 2012). Archival data can\n",
      "provide a wealth of information about ﬁrms and how they function, including how they employ\n",
      "technology. The researchers followed a few archival research processes from the McMaster\n",
      "University Library’s Research Guides (2023). The researchers have described the archival research\n",
      "process as shown in Figure 1.\n",
      "3Figure 1. Overall research process\n",
      "The researchers analyzed and described the collected data using an “introductory literature\n",
      "review.” Despite the widespread usage of an introductory literature review, it is usually diﬃcult\n",
      "to justify. One of the consequences of the emergence of meta-analysis and other types of\n",
      "systematic reviews has been to raise the standard for all sorts of literature reviews. This is one of\n",
      "the outcomes of the rise of systematic reviews. Most people believe, at least on a fundamental\n",
      "level, that research reports in a literature review require the same rigor, reliability, and objectivity\n",
      "as any other examination of research ﬁndings. In this scenario, an introduction review is only\n",
      "appropriate for a modest preliminary study or when the studied topic is addressed in only a few\n",
      "published articles (Vogt et al. 2012).\n",
      "2.1 Applications of ChatGPT in Writing Research Articles Based on Practical Examples\n",
      "In recent years, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) has been considered one of the most eﬀective tools\n",
      "for developing education globally. And the interest in the application of AI in higher education is\n",
      "gradually increasing. Hence, ChatGPT is a buzzword for the academic community, from students\n",
      "to researchers. To prove this, researchers focused on the applications of ChatGPT in writing\n",
      "research articles based on practical examples. Therefore, researchers selected a demo research\n",

      "of ChatGPT and to uncover the critical challenges of employing ChatGPT chatbots in academic\n",

      "2.2 ChatGPT and Research Idea Generation\n",
      "The experiment with ChatGPT revealed that the chatbot is quite successful in generating new\n",

      "The chatbot generated a literature review consisting of the literature ﬁndings from ﬁve articles.\n",
      "ChatGPT provided standard in-text citations and references in APA style. Moreover, for cross-\n",
      "checking, the researchers searched the references in google scholar and other scholarly research\n",
      "databases. However, the researchers have yet to ﬁnd those references anywhere on the internet.\n",
      "5Interestingly, when asked to provide the DOI or the original URL of the references that ChatGPT\n",
      "provided, the AI chatbot mentioned that it does not have access to the original articles. Thus, it\n",
      "generated a few made-up nonexistent in-text citations and references (Figure 4). ChatGPT cannot\n",
      "access academic references or other external data as an LLM. Its knowledge is derived from the\n",
      "training text, which has a deﬁned endpoint. The AI bot cannot browse the internet or access\n",
      "new material that may have been released since its training data was gathered. Consequently,\n",
      "the inability of AI chatbots to perform an authentic literature review with original references is a\n",
      "signiﬁcant limitation of the blind use of AI chatbots in academic article writing.\n",
      "Figure 4. Failure to provide authentic references\n",

      "researchers can use ChatGPT as an assistant to summarize articles to write a literature review\n",
      "further. However, due to less success in synthesizing prior literature ﬁndings, researchers should\n",
      "not rely entirely on the chatbot to write a literature review.\n",
      "2.5 GPT and Findings Analysis\n",
      "ChatGPT is currently unable to analyze empirical data (Dowling and Lucey (2023). Therefore,\n",
      "the researchers could not assess its data analysis ability. They asked the chatbot to conduct a\n",
      "thematic analysis on the demo topic without access to empirical data. ChatGPT mentioned that\n",
      "6with access to actual data, it could conduct a thematic analysis and write results section (Figure\n",
      "6).\n",
      "Figure 6. Failure to analyze the emperical data\n",
      "Although the chatbot cannot analyze empirical data for quantitative techniques, researchers can\n",
      "take help from ChatGPT to know the necessary basic theoretical ideas about their analyzing tools\n",
      "and techniques. However, for qualitative research, ChatGPT might be helpful for researchers. For\n",
      "instance, they can collect qualitative data from face-to-face interviews, key informant interviews,\n",
      "and focus group discussions. If a researcher provides the transcribed qualitative data to ChatGPT\n",
      "and asks it to analyze the text using appropriate prompts, ChatGPT might provide an adequate\n",
      "qualitative analysis output. For instance, if they conduct a few interviews on the “Adoption\n",
      "of AI in higher education” and provide the transcribed interview data to ChatGPT with proper\n",
      "commands, the chatbot can generate the expected results for the study. However, it requires\n",
      "speciﬁc expertise and the attention of the researcher to develop a sound output.\n",
      "3 Results and Discussions\n",
      "Recently, academicians and practitioners worldwide have taken a keen interest in ChatGPT,\n",
      "a conversational AI tool (Rahaman et al., 2023). It is anticipated that conversational AI may\n",
      "entirely transform the research and publication process, which might bring opportunities or raise\n",
      "worries. ChatGPT has diﬀerent prospects, including innovation process, promoting diversity in\n",
      "scientiﬁc research perspectives, and short time- to-publication by simplifying writing. Besides\n",
      "these potentialities, it may undermine research quality and transparency and alter the autonomy\n",
      "as human researchers. The authors’ interactions with ChatGPT assert that ChatGPT, an AI chatbot,\n",
      "can be an eﬀective research assistance tool for eﬃciently designing manuscripts. Swift answers\n",
      "to any basic queries regarding academic research researchers can be possible through ChatGPT.\n",
      "Furthermore, ChatGPT is readily accessible to researchers worldwide, anytime and anywhere,\n",
      "with an internet connection, thus making it an accessible research tool. Moreover, its capacity\n",
      "to generate new and innovative outputs based on input can help researchers generate fresh\n",
      "ideas, perspectives, and insights. ChatGPT can enhance researchers’ productivity and enable\n",
      "them to focus on other aspects of their research by supporting tasks such as new idea generation,\n",
      "literature summarization, and writing assistance.\n",
      "In this research, the researchers tried to assess the capabilities of the ChatGPT in academic\n",
      "research by using a demo research topic titled “Adoption of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in Higher\n",
      "Education.” They attempted to investigate the challenges of using ChatGPT in writing a paper.\n",
      "The ﬁndings revealed that ChatGPT could generate a standard abstract for a research article when\n",
      "given accurate and precise prompts. However, it fails to generate standard output for diﬀerent\n",
      "research article sections. For instance, the AI chatbot generates a hypothetical problem statement\n",
      "and research gaps for the introduction section. As it cannot access original articles, it can not\n",
      "identify the original research gap for a particular research topic.\n",
      "Additionally, The researchers found that ChatGPT generates fake made-up citations while writing\n",
      "any literature review. They cross-checked all the given references in academic databases and\n",
      "found that all of the references are hypothetical. Further, the tool must synthesize the literature,\n",
      "7the fundamental objective of writing a literature review. It cannot conduct statistical analysis\n",
      "as it cannot access actual data. One cannot upload dataﬁle into ChatGPT; thus, the tool cannot\n",
      "conduct empirical analysis. However, ChatGPT can provide a decent output for a few qualitative\n",
      "data analyses if the transcribed data is provided.\n",
      "Additionally, it can write a proper methodology if the researcher can provide all the information\n",
      "regarding the research methods used. However, giving an accurate prompt is crucial in this\n",
      "context. Some of the other limitations of using ChatGPT in writing research articles include\n",
      "but are not limited to the next section. The ﬁrst and foremost limitation is that ChatGPT can\n",
      "produce well-structured and coherent text but cannot generate original and creative ideas, which\n",
      "is crucial in academic research where originality and creativity are highly valued. Second, ChatGPT\n",
      "is trained on a vast corpus of text data that may include biases and inaccuracies, leading to\n",
      "biased results and aﬀecting performance. The following limitation is that ChatGPT is an AI model\n",
      "and cannot be held accountable for the validity and accuracy of its generated results, which\n",
      "can pose a challenge in academic research where accountability and transparency are crucial.\n",
      "The last fast limitation is ChatGPT, which cannot understand the context of the generated text,\n",
      "which can produce irrelevant or inappropriate text, particularly in situations requiring a nuanced\n",
      "understanding of the topic. Finally, last but not least, the results generated by ChatGPT can be\n",
      "challenging to interpret and understand, limiting the researchers’ ability to validate the results\n",
      "and identify the underlying sources of bias or inaccuracies.\n",
      "Despite these challenges, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in academic research, mainly when used\n",
      "with other techniques and methods. The use of ChatGPT in academic research holds signiﬁcant\n",
      "potential, including improved eﬃciency, accuracy, and communication. By leveraging these\n",
      "beneﬁts, researchers can gain new insights into their research domains and better communicate\n",
      "their ﬁndings to a broader audience. The use of ChatGPT in academic research is a rapidly growing\n",
      "area. As technology continues to develop, researchers can expect to see even more beneﬁts\n",
      "emerge in the future.\n",

LLMs such as ChatGPT\\ncan generate human-like text by imitating the statistical patterns of language in vast datasets from\\nthe internet. ChatGPT can generate convincing sentences using Natural Language Processing\\n(NLP) for the researchers. Few recent studies have examined the potentiality and use of ChatGPT\\nin various parts or domains of academic research. For example, Grimaldi and Ehrler (2023) andHutson et al. (2022) have taken a broad perspective on the emerging role of AI in scholarly\\nresearch.\\nHowever, another study done by M Alshater (2022) and the ﬁndings suggested that ChatGPT could\\nbe a helpful tool for constructing research ideas. Still, it is not an appropriate tool for empirical\\nresearch. Empirical research has some essential parts such as an abstract, introduction, literature\\nreview, methodology, results, discussions on ﬁndings, and conclusions. However, ChatGPT might\\nonly help cover some of these parts. For example, Aydın and Karaarslan (2022) attempted to\\ncomplete a healthcare literature review for an academic journal. Still, poor paraphrasing, lack of\\nsynthesis, and plagiarism were the leading causes of not getting a good literature review. On\\nthe other hand, Gao et al. (2022) found a well-structured abstract without explicit plagiarism.\\nHowever, it could be identiﬁed as being generated by an AI platform using an AI output detector.\\nAnother recent study was done by Dowling and Lucey (2023) on applying ChatGPT in ﬁnance\\nresearch. From the ﬁndings of that study, it is clear that for the initial idea generation, ChatGPT is\\nan excellent tool. Still, it must be more vital in literature synthesis and developing appropriate\\ntesting frameworks.\\nIn the academic world, academicians, researchers, and students have already employed LLMs such\\nas ChatGPT to complete their various academic and non-academic tasks. However, according\\nto Gordijn and Have (2023), ChatGPT still needs to improve at developing a whole scientiﬁc\\narticle than a good researcher. However, it is predicted that the capabilities and uses of these\\ntools may continue to expand to diﬀerent points, including designing experiments, writing and\\ncompleting manuscripts, conducting peer reviews, and supporting editorial decisions (van Dis et\\nal., 2023). Besides, ChatGPT can produce and receive texts in multiple languages, which helps\\ndisseminate knowledge; it may enable those whose ﬁrst language is not English to publish and\\naccess scholarly literature more eﬃciently (Liebrenz et al., 2023). However, considering the\\npotential consequences of ChatGPT, it might beneﬁt the academic community, but; it is a must\\nfor the scientiﬁc community to establish the necessary guidelines for the appropriate use of LLMs\\nin research and publishing.\\n1.1 Can ChatGPT be an Author or a Co-author? Current Status!\\nBesides ChatGPT, other LMSs have become widespread, thus; their impacts on academic research\\nand publication have been scrutinized. It is seen from the diﬀerent blogs and websites that some\\nauthors are considering ChatGPT as one of their co-authors. For instance, the studies- ChatGPT\\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer and Zhavoronkov (2022) and O’Connor and ChatGPT (2022)\\nhave listed the chatbot as the article’s author. Using ChatGPT and considering it as authorship\\nin academic research have sparked a debate about the future of scholarly research production\\n(Else, 2023, Stokel-Walker, 2023). Due to this concern, some renowned publishers such as Nature\\n(Nature, 2023) Springer-Nature (Springer-Nature, 2023), Elsevier (Elsevier, 2023), Taylor and\\nFrancis (Taylor Francis, 2023) have already updated their authorship policies. According to the\\nrecent authorship policies of Springer-Nature, ChatGPT cannot be listed as an author in any\\nacademic research paper. If any researchers uses these tools, s(he) must mention their use in the\\nappropriate section of their academic paper, such as the \"methodology\" or \"acknowledgment\"\\nsection (Dwivedi et al., 2023).\\nOn the other hand, Elsevier, a renowned publisher, has also revised its authorship policies due\\nto the extensive use of LLMs in academic research (Liebrenz et al., 2023). Elsevier stated that\\nLLMs could only help improve their articles’ language and readability, not data interpretation\\nor scientiﬁc ﬁndings (Sankaran, 2023). There are many debates about using LLMs in academicLLMs could only help improve their articles’ language and readability, not data interpretation\\nor scientiﬁc ﬁndings (Sankaran, 2023). There are many debates about using LLMs in academic\\nresearch appropriately. From the above publishers’ recent authorship policies, it is clear that\\nhuman authors remain central to the academic research process. These debates will continue,\\nand many new policies and guidelines will be introduced due to the use of ChatGPT in academic\\nresearch. A few examples are given as the summary as shown in Table 1. To prepare this table,\\nthey took help from a study done by (Dwivedi et al., 2023).\\n2Table 1. Updated authorship policy of publishers regarding LLMs, AI, and ChatGPT\\nPublisher Updated authorship policy Remark\\nSpringer-Nature\\n(2023)LLMs, such as ChatGPT, do not satisfy\\nthe authorship criteria. However, if\\nthe researchers uses these tools, s(he)\\nmust mention their use in the appropriate\\nsection of their academic paper, such as\\nthe \"methodology\" or \"acknowledgment\"\\nsection.ChatGPT cannot be an\\nauthor or co-author.\\nTaylor & Francis\\n(2023)Authors must be accountable for their\\nresearch work per the publishing agreement.\\nAs AI tools do not take this accountability,\\nthus; AI tools cannot be co-author in an\\nacademic paper. However, if a researcher\\nuses these tools, s(he) must mention their\\nuse in the appropriate section.ChatGPT cannot be an\\nauthor or co-author.\\nElsevier (2023) Though AI and AI-assisted technologies help\\nyou to enhance the quality and readability\\nof the language of the work, they do\\nnot replace key researchers. Thus, the\\nresearchers are not allowed to list AI and\\nAI-assisted technologies as an author or co-\\nauthor nor cite AI as an author.ChatGPT cannot be an\\nauthor or co-author.\\n2 Methodology\\nThe authors selected a demo research topic titled \"Adoption of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in', metadata={}), Document(page_content='Higher Education\" to highlight the application of ChatGPT and uncover the critical challenges of\\nemploying AI chatbots such as ChatGPT in academic research. ChatGPT version 3.5 was used to\\nassess its application in academic research. Besides, the researchers used an archive research\\ndesign. Researchers can use this method to collect information utilizing historical or non-historical\\ndocuments (Ventresca, 2017).\\nData for this study was gathered using websites, blogs, and visual and numerical artifacts. Data for\\narchive study is collected rather than generated. Archival research is a secondary data-collecting\\napproach that involves acquiring information from existing sources such as public documents,\\ncompany records, historical papers, websites, and blogs (Vogt et al., 2012). Archival data can\\nprovide a wealth of information about ﬁrms and how they function, including how they employ\\ntechnology. The researchers followed a few archival research processes from the McMaster\\nUniversity Library’s Research Guides (2023). The researchers have described the archival research\\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\\n3Figure 1. Overall research process\\nThe researchers analyzed and described the collected data using an “introductory literature\\nreview.” Despite the widespread usage of an introductory literature review, it is usually diﬃcult\\nto justify. One of the consequences of the emergence of meta-analysis and other types of\\nsystematic reviews has been to raise the standard for all sorts of literature reviews. This is one of\\nthe outcomes of the rise of systematic reviews. Most people believe, at least on a fundamental\\nlevel, that research reports in a literature review require the same rigor, reliability, and objectivity\\nas any other examination of research ﬁndings. In this scenario, an introduction review is only\\nappropriate for a modest preliminary study or when the studied topic is addressed in only a few\\npublished articles (Vogt et al. 2012).\\n2.1 Applications of ChatGPT in Writing Research Articles Based on Practical Examples\\nIn recent years, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) has been considered one of the most eﬀective tools\\nfor developing education globally. And the interest in the application of AI in higher education is\\ngradually increasing. Hence, ChatGPT is a buzzword for the academic community, from students\\nto researchers. To prove this, researchers focused on the applications of ChatGPT in writing\\nresearch articles based on practical examples. Therefore, researchers selected a demo research\\ntopic titled “Adoption of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education” to highlight the application\\nof ChatGPT and to uncover the critical challenges of employing ChatGPT chatbots in academic\\nresearch. In this section, the researchers assessed the capability of ChatGPT in academic research\\nby providing several commands to write diﬀerent sections of the demo research manuscript,\\nincluding:\\n•Research idea generation\\n•Background/Introduction (including problem statement and research gaps)\\n•Literature review with citations and references,\\n•Methodology,\\n•Results and discussion.\\n2.2 ChatGPT and Research Idea Generation\\nThe experiment with ChatGPT revealed that the chatbot is quite successful in generating new\\nresearch ideas and developing research outlines. The authors may take these ideas to implement,\\nbut human interference is a must at any time and anywhere. Besides, ChatGPT can provide a\\ndetailed outline of a research paper.\\n42.3 ChatGPT and Introduction Including Problem Statement and Research Gaps\\nWriting a background or an introduction with the problem statement and research gap is one\\nof the most challenging tasks for academic researchers. The problem statement and gap are\\ncrucial components of an introduction to a research paper. The fundamental objective of a\\nproblem statement is to draw attention to the matter of concern and to clarify it so that it can be\\ninvestigated systematically. The researcher in this study asked ChatGPT to write the problem\\nstatement and research gap for the demo research topic. The prompt and the output from\\nChatGPT are presented as a snapshot in Figure 2.\\nFigure 2. Problem statement and research gap generated by ChatGPT\\nFrom the command and response from ChatGPT, it has been that the problem statement generated\\nby the chatbot is entirely hypothetical without any references. Further, ChatGPT needs to identify\\noriginal research gaps from the literature but provides a generalized gap for any research topic.\\nSince ChatGPT cannot access original articles, it cannot provide proper references for the gaps in\\nthe literature.\\n2.4 ChatGPT and Synthesis Literature Review\\nIn the second stage, ChatGPT has been asked to write a literature review on the “adoption of\\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in higher education” with APA-style in-text citations and references. The\\nprompt and the output from ChatGPT are presented as a snapshot in Figure 3.\\nFigure 3. Made-up nonexistent references\\nThe chatbot generated a literature review consisting of the literature ﬁndings from ﬁve articles.\\nChatGPT provided standard in-text citations and references in APA style. Moreover, for cross-\\nchecking, the researchers searched the references in google scholar and other scholarly research\\ndatabases. However, the researchers have yet to ﬁnd those references anywhere on the internet.\\n5Interestingly, when asked to provide the DOI or the original URL of the references that ChatGPT\\nprovided, the AI chatbot mentioned that it does not have access to the original articles. Thus, it\\ngenerated a few made-up nonexistent in-text citations and references (Figure 4). ChatGPT cannot\\naccess academic references or other external data as an LLM. Its knowledge is derived from the\\ntraining text, which has a deﬁned endpoint. The AI bot cannot browse the internet or access\\nnew material that may have been released since its training data was gathered. Consequently,\\nthe inability of AI chatbots to perform an authentic literature review with original references is a\\nsigniﬁcant limitation of the blind use of AI chatbots in academic article writing.\\nFigure 4. Failure to provide authentic references\\nIn the next stage, the researchers tested the chatbot to determine whether it could adequately\\nsynthesize the literature. However, ChatGPT is less successful in synthesizing prior literature\\nﬁndings and writing a formal literature review. When asked to write a literature review on\\nthe “Adoption of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education,” the chatbot provided multiple\\nparagraphs citing a few studies and demonstrating their ﬁndings (Figure 5). However, no link was\\nestablished between the ﬁndings of the other literature. Hence, researchers should not solely\\nrely on the ChatGPT to write a literature review for an article.\\nFigure 5. Weak literature synthesis\\nFor example, Dowling and Lucey (2023) recently conducted a study on the application of ChatGPT\\nin Finance research by evaluating the generated output by ﬁnance journal reviewers. The authors\\nstated that this technology needs to be up to that level in synthesizing the literature and developing\\nappropriate testing frameworks. However, when private data and researchers’ domain expertise\\nare applied, chatGPT can oﬀer an improved literature review. Thus, it can be concluded that\\nresearchers can use ChatGPT as an assistant to summarize articles to write a literature review\\nfurther. However, due to less success in synthesizing prior literature ﬁndings, researchers should\\nnot rely entirely on the chatbot to write a literature review.\\n2.5 GPT and Findings Analysis\\nChatGPT is currently unable to analyze empirical data (Dowling and Lucey (2023). Therefore,\\nthe researchers could not assess its data analysis ability. They asked the chatbot to conduct a\\nthematic analysis on the demo topic without access to empirical data. ChatGPT mentioned that\\n6with access to actual data, it could conduct a thematic analysis and write results section (Figure\\n6).\\nFigure 6. Failure to analyze the emperical data\\nAlthough the chatbot cannot analyze empirical data for quantitative techniques, researchers can\\ntake help from ChatGPT to know the necessary basic theoretical ideas about their analyzing tools\\nand techniques. However, for qualitative research, ChatGPT might be helpful for researchers. For\\ninstance, they can collect qualitative data from face-to-face interviews, key informant interviews,\\nand focus group discussions. If a researcher provides the transcribed qualitative data to ChatGPT\\nand asks it to analyze the text using appropriate prompts, ChatGPT might provide an adequate\\nqualitative analysis output. For instance, if they conduct a few interviews on the “Adoption\\nof AI in higher education” and provide the transcribed interview data to ChatGPT with proper\\ncommands, the chatbot can generate the expected results for the study. However, it requires\\nspeciﬁc expertise and the attention of the researcher to develop a sound output.\\n3 Results and Discussions\\nRecently, academicians and practitioners worldwide have taken a keen interest in ChatGPT,\\na conversational AI tool (Rahaman et al., 2023). It is anticipated that conversational AI may\\nentirely transform the research and publication process, which might bring opportunities or raise\\nworries. ChatGPT has diﬀerent prospects, including innovation process, promoting diversity in\\nscientiﬁc research perspectives, and short time- to-publication by simplifying writing. Besides\\nthese potentialities, it may undermine research quality and transparency and alter the autonomy\\nas human researchers. The authors’ interactions with ChatGPT assert that ChatGPT, an AI chatbot,\\ncan be an eﬀective research assistance tool for eﬃciently designing manuscripts. Swift answers\\nto any basic queries regarding academic research researchers can be possible through ChatGPT.\\nFurthermore, ChatGPT is readily accessible to researchers worldwide, anytime and anywhere,', metadata={}), Document(page_content='with an internet connection, thus making it an accessible research tool. Moreover, its capacity\\nto generate new and innovative outputs based on input can help researchers generate fresh\\nideas, perspectives, and insights. ChatGPT can enhance researchers’ productivity and enable\\nthem to focus on other aspects of their research by supporting tasks such as new idea generation,\\nliterature summarization, and writing assistance.\\nIn this research, the researchers tried to assess the capabilities of the ChatGPT in academic\\nresearch by using a demo research topic titled “Adoption of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in Higher\\nEducation.” They attempted to investigate the challenges of using ChatGPT in writing a paper.\\nThe ﬁndings revealed that ChatGPT could generate a standard abstract for a research article when\\ngiven accurate and precise prompts. However, it fails to generate standard output for diﬀerent\\nresearch article sections. For instance, the AI chatbot generates a hypothetical problem statement\\nand research gaps for the introduction section. As it cannot access original articles, it can not\\nidentify the original research gap for a particular research topic.\\nAdditionally, The researchers found that ChatGPT generates fake made-up citations while writing\\nany literature review. They cross-checked all the given references in academic databases and\\nfound that all of the references are hypothetical. Further, the tool must synthesize the literature,\\n7the fundamental objective of writing a literature review. It cannot conduct statistical analysis\\nas it cannot access actual data. One cannot upload dataﬁle into ChatGPT; thus, the tool cannot\\nconduct empirical analysis. However, ChatGPT can provide a decent output for a few qualitative\\ndata analyses if the transcribed data is provided.\\nAdditionally, it can write a proper methodology if the researcher can provide all the information\\nregarding the research methods used. However, giving an accurate prompt is crucial in this\\ncontext. Some of the other limitations of using ChatGPT in writing research articles include\\nbut are not limited to the next section. The ﬁrst and foremost limitation is that ChatGPT can\\nproduce well-structured and coherent text but cannot generate original and creative ideas, which\\nis crucial in academic research where originality and creativity are highly valued. Second, ChatGPT\\nis trained on a vast corpus of text data that may include biases and inaccuracies, leading to\\nbiased results and aﬀecting performance. The following limitation is that ChatGPT is an AI model\\nand cannot be held accountable for the validity and accuracy of its generated results, which\\ncan pose a challenge in academic research where accountability and transparency are crucial.\\nThe last fast limitation is ChatGPT, which cannot understand the context of the generated text,\\nwhich can produce irrelevant or inappropriate text, particularly in situations requiring a nuanced\\nunderstanding of the topic. Finally, last but not least, the results generated by ChatGPT can be\\nchallenging to interpret and understand, limiting the researchers’ ability to validate the results\\nand identify the underlying sources of bias or inaccuracies.\\nDespite these challenges, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in academic research, mainly when used\\nwith other techniques and methods. The use of ChatGPT in academic research holds signiﬁcant\\npotential, including improved eﬃciency, accuracy, and communication. By leveraging these\\nbeneﬁts, researchers can gain new insights into their research domains and better communicate\\ntheir ﬁndings to a broader audience. The use of ChatGPT in academic research is a rapidly growing\\narea. As technology continues to develop, researchers can expect to see even more beneﬁts\\nemerge in the future.\\n4 Summary of the Findings and Recommendations for Academic Researcher\\nBased on the researchers’ practical example, a summary of the ﬁndings relating to the various\\nparts of an academic research paper is shown in Table 2. Besides, the authors of this study suggest\\nsome recommendations for academic researchers:\\nTable 2. Recommendations for Academic Researcher\\nComponents of\\nAcademic ResearchAuthors’ Findings Recommendations\\nInitial Idea Generation ChatGPT is an eﬀective tool for\\nidea generation, brainstorming,\\nand outlining research topics.As no ethical considerations\\nare associated with initial idea\\ngeneration, thus; for this section,\\nthe researchers can use ChatGPT.\\nNonetheless, researchers should\\nverify the accuracy and reliability\\nof any information provided by\\nChatGPT.\\n8Introduction The authors’ found that ChatGPT\\ncan generate an introduction\\nwithout a formal problem\\nstatement and research gap.\\nBesides, the introduction part is\\nentirely hypothetical, without\\nany references.ChatGPT can support identifying\\nnew research directions, ﬁnding\\npotential research questions,\\nand formulating hypothesis.\\nBut, it is strongly recommended\\nthat academic researchers only\\npartially depend on ChatGPT for\\nthis crucial part as it cannot be\\nutilized to accurately generate\\nresearch questions, problem\\nstatements, research gaps, and\\nhypothesis.\\nLiterature Review ChatGPT can summarise and\\ncompile the literature into\\na literature review without\\nemphasizing synthesizing and\\ncoherence. ChatGPT cannot\\ndevelop a story based on existing\\nliterature. Second, if a researcher\\ninstructs ChatGPT to compose\\na literature review, it generates\\nﬁctitious and hypothetical in-text\\ncitations and references.The researchers advise utilizing\\nChatGPT to summarise extensive\\nliterature rather than writing the\\nliterature review section by using\\nChatGPT. Besides, academic\\nresearchers are requested to\\nrefrain from using citations\\nand references produced from\\nChatGPT directly.\\nMethodology ChatGPT can provide a decent\\noutput for a few qualitative data\\nanalyses if the transcribed data\\nis provided. Additionally, it can\\nwrite a proper methodology if\\nthe researcher can provide all\\nthe information regarding the\\nresearch methods used.Academic researchers might\\ntake help from ChatGPT to get\\na preliminary idea of how to\\ndesign their methodology section.\\nHowever, all the information\\nconcerning methodology needs\\nto be input properly according\\nto the nature (qualitative or\\nquantitative) of the research,\\nData Analysis and\\nFindingsThe researchers cannot upload\\ndata ﬁles (Excel, SPSS) to\\nChatGPT, so they cannot be\\nused for empirical analysis. But\\nif the transcribed data is given,\\nChatGPT can provide good\\nresults for a few qualitative data\\nanalyses.For quantitative data analysis, the\\nresearcher should avoid ChatGPT.\\nBut, researchers can take help\\nfrom ChatGPT to know the\\nnecessary basic theoretical ideas\\nabout their analyzing tools and\\ntechniques.\\nOverall Recommendations: ChatGPT should be utilized as one of many research information\\nsources. Instead, it should be utilized as a complement to help improve the study procedure.\\nFinally, as ChatGPT is NLP which is ﬁrmly command based, the new AI model can be helpful to\\nthe academic researcher with the understanding of human interference when needed.\\n5 Conclusion and Implications\\nThe fundamental objective of this study is to highlight the application of ChatGPT in academic\\nresearch by demonstrating a practical example with some valuable recommendations. This study\\ndraws upon a demo research topic and investigates the potential and limitations of ChatGPT in\\ndrafting and writing an academic research paper. The study revealed that ChatGPT has several\\nadvantages for researchers regarding new idea generation, outlining a research topic, even writing\\nabstracts using prompts, etc. Second, the researchers recommend that academic researchers\\n9may use this tool to summarize large text and identify key ﬁndings from the literature. However,\\nthe researchers also observed several limitations of ChatGPT in writing an academic article. For\\ninstance, ChatGPT sometimes misleads in writing the research problem, questions, and gaps since\\nit provides hypothetical problem statements and research gaps with fake references. However, it\\nshould only be used to write part of the literature review section as the tool can not synthesize\\nliterature and generates made-up citations and references. Besides, ChatGPT cannot conduct\\nstatistical analysis because it cannot access the dataset. Thus, the researchers recommend not\\nusing ChatGPT to write a research article alone; human control should be apparent. Instead, this\\ntool can be used as an e-research assistant that can complement diﬀerent works of a researcher\\nand improve work eﬃciency. Since accountability and research integrity are two major concerns\\nin academic publishing, researchers should take full accountability for using ChatGPT in research\\nand mention its use in the article. As this is one of the ﬁrst studies that assess the application of\\nChatGPT in academic research, the ﬁndings will have full and crucial implications for theory and\\npractice.\\n6 Acknowledgment\\nAll authors would like to express their gratitude to the authors of the cited literature for their\\nassistance and important information.
